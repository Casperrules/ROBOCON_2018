Codes for selection of zone using pixy and an ultrasonic sensor
the ultrasonic is on the side where the ball for Tz3 is to be transfered
pixy is on the other side and detects if the color of the ball on its side is green or magenta
according to the readings of both the sensors the zone is selected for which the bot should head in order to throw the ball
