Important Points to be noted:
1.Power stepper using the Buck Convertors and not the 5V available on the arduino
2.For Powering of the sharp ir and the push button use the 5V available on the arduino
3.For the Push down use the pull down mode of operation 
	a.For this connect one of the terminal of the Button to the 5V
	b.Ground the Push Button using the 10k ohm (Pull-Down) Resistor
	c.Take the signal from the resistance and button junction point and feed it into the arduino
4.For sharp IR also we will be using a Pull-Down Configuration for increasing the efficiency
	a.Here also connect the Vcc Pin to the 5V
	b. Connect the Ground pin to the ground directly
	c.Use a k resistor and connect it between the ground and the signal pin
	d.Take output accress the resistor signal pin Junction and then feed it into the arduino
5.If using 7805 Regulator to power up the steppers make sure the battery input voltage is greater then 7V else the Whole system will fail even though everything will seem to work
