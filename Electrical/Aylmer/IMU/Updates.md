DAY1:The connections are done and the values doesnt make sense! Tried calibrating it. It is understood that the offset value of the sensor should be found out before starting the calibration process. I have attached an arduino sketch to find the offset value of the sensor.The initial problem I encountered was the value from the sensor were in several thousands when it was in rest position. And also the values in gyroscope were changing dynamically which literally makes no sense. At the end of the day i found this website useful. http://wired.chillibasket.com/2015/01/calibrating-mpu6050/
